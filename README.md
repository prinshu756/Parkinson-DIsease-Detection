Parkinson Disease Detection 🧠🩺

This project focuses on detecting Parkinson’s Disease using Machine Learning techniques based on biomedical voice measurements. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing patterns in patient data.

📌 About the Project

Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and speech. Early detection can significantly improve patient care and quality of life.

This project:

Uses machine learning algorithms to classify Parkinson’s Disease

Works on structured biomedical datasets

Demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

🧪 Dataset

The dataset consists of voice measurements extracted from patients

Each record represents a patient

Target column indicates whether the patient has Parkinson’s Disease

Typical features include:

Fundamental frequency
